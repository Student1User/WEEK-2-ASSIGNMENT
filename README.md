## **Week 2 Assignment - Python Data Structures 🐍📚**  

### **Overview**  
This project demonstrates the use of **lists** and their built-in methods in Python. The program performs various operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and indexing elements in a list.  

### **Features Implemented**  
✔️ Create an empty list (`my_list`).  
✔️ Append values **10, 20, 30, 40** to the list.  
✔️ Insert the value **15** at the second position.  
✔️ Extend the list with another list **[50, 60, 70]**.  
✔️ Remove the last element from the list.  
✔️ Sort the list in **ascending order**.  
✔️ Find and print the index of the value **30**.  

### **How to Run the Code**  
1. Clone the repository or download the script.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script.  
3. Run the script using:  
   ```sh
   python week2.py
   ```  

### **Expected Output**  
```
Index of 30: 3
Final List: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```

### **Learning Outcomes**  
📌 Understanding Python **lists** and their operations.  
📌 Practicing **list methods** like `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.extend()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`, and `.index()`.  
📌 Strengthening problem-solving skills with **basic data structures**.
